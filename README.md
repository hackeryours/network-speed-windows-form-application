This Program is a very Basic Idea with a very minimal design, it is a Fast.com Dupliclate used to calculate you internet download speed by downloading a simple file and calculating the time in which this file got downloaded using a webclient.
there is a method Called Speed Which need a string parameter that is used to get the download speed first we call the webclient class from the namespace system.net & system.net.network information.
and then getting the data downloadled from the url and storing it in a byte variable 
then diving the data downloaded on the total time will give us the very basic not very acccurate download speed.
then there is the tmr_tick used to loop around the methood speed every second.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

this project still has very big room to expand we wanted to expanded and calculate the average of the download speed
make the user choose how to view there internet download speed, in kbps or mbps etc..

this is our code. enjoy!
